        <div class="problem">
            <h2>So what's the problem?</h2>
            <p>We discovered that there is a limited amount of educational material for financial literacy that was easy to access and understand. This likely leads to unequal opportunities to invest and save. </p>
            <p>Our goal was to learn users’ frustrations, needs and goals in regards to financial literacy. Depending on users’ needs, we wanted to create an app/website to provide equitable learning for financial literacy. This would allow users to be more willing to invest in stocks or increase banking as they would have more knowledge. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="findings">
            <h2>What we found:</h2>
            <img src="../images/stats.jpg" alt="We surveyed 41 users about their level of knowledge in financial literacy, their preferred learning style, and what their learning goals would be. 
            ">

        <div class="quotes">
            <h2>Here's what some of our respondents had to say...</h2>
            <p>“I think everyone's goals and capabilities are so different that an advisor would be able to help me specifically”</p>
            <p>“[I like learning through webinars/websites because it’s] easy, accessible, and non-judgemental.”</p>
        </div>

        <div class="secondary_analysis">
            <h2>Is there anything else out there?</h2>
            <p>I conducted secondary analysis to determine if there was a need for a platform for improving financial literacy in the way we were thinking. There were many apps on the market to assist individuals with investing but there was not much in terms of providing individuals with the tools to learn more about financial literacy in general (including topics such as budgeting, how to pay of debts in the best way, etc.).</p>
        <div class="pain_points">
            <h2>What needed to be done</h2>
            <p>We discovered a few wants/pain points for users and came up with these solutions:</p>
            <img src="../images/Pain_Solution.jpg" alt="Users liked being able to learn at their own pace and preferred learning through websites/webinars:
            Solution: create a website that users can go through and learn at their own pace
            Users preferred speaking to a financial advisor 1:1 to help them through investments.
            Solution: implement an option for users to speak to a financial advisor 1:1 either through a chat box or a video call. 
            Users found terminology surrounding financial literacy difficult to understand:
            Solution: Ensure terminology on the website would be friendly for beginners/non-beginners alike.">

            <h2>Rough drafts</h2>
            <p>We created wireframes and low-fidelity prototypes (shown below) to give us a sense of what exactly the website might look like.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="final_product">
            <h2>The final product (for now)</h2>
            <p>This is the current flow of the website:</p>
            <img src="../images/user_flow.jpg" alt="A picture of the user flow">
            <p>The protoype itself on Figma:</p>
            <div class="prototype">            
                <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FN56ac5AwXP1chec20rdkAM%2FPrototype%3Fpage-id%3D11%253A4%26node-id%3D31%253A46%26viewport%3D-2296%252C311%252C0.21%26scaling%3Dscale-down%26starting-point-node-id%3D31%253A46" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            </div>
            <p>And some screen-shots of the prototype:</p>
            <img src="../images/create_account_page.jpg" alt="Create an account page">
            <img src="../images/question_page.jpg" alt="question page">
            <img src="../images/home_page.jpg" alt="home page">
            <img src="../images/last_page.jpg" alt="last page of website with option to talk to a financial advisor">
            <p>As you can see, the website aims to curate the users’ response from the quiz to tailor topics and learning levels. Additionally, we wanted to have the option for users to speak to a financial advisor either using the chat option on the bottom right of the browser or booking a 1:1 session. This could also give banks the opportunity to pair with the website and provide their financial advisors so users could have the option to invest with a bank. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="next">
            <h2>What's next...</h2>
            <p>There are always room for improvements and this website is no exception. To improve the website I would conduct further user testing and continue to iterate to make improvements. One user indicated they enjoyed the badge feature. As a result, I am currently expanding on that idea and adding more to the prototype to show a badge/rewards page. It might also be beneficial to get in contact with others who are in finance to determine what areas are missing and what we could add to enhance the website.  </p>
